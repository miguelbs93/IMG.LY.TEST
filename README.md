# IMG.LY.TEST

## Overview

IMG.LY.TEST is an iOS application developed using Swift and SwiftUI. The project demonstrates the implementation of a hierarchical tree structure with network-based data fetching, displaying tree nodes, and handling user interactions such as deleting and moving items. I have decided to modularize the app through SPM, and separate the concerns through different modules.


## Features

- Fetches hierarchical tree data from a remote API.
- Displays tree nodes in a structured list.
- Supports deleting and rearranging tree items.
- Provides detailed views for leaf nodes.
- Shows loading states and error handling for network requests.
- Changing the theme of the app


## Technologies Used

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- MVVM Architecture
- Async/Await for network calls
- Unit Testing with XCTest
